                                    Known for his philosophical interests, Aurelius was one of the most respected emperors in Roman history.

                                <p>
                                    His greatest intellectual interest was Stoicism, a philosophy that emphasized fate, reason and self-restraint.
                                </p>

                                    From 170 to 180, Aurelius wrote <q>Meditations,</q> a philosophical text. 
                                </p>

                                    The book was first published in 1558 in Zurich, and the only remaining copy can be found in the Vatican library.

                                    He was posthumously honored with the title <q>philosopher-king</q>; a title that still exists today.
                                </p>

                                    13 centuries after his rule, Italian Renaissance diplomat and writer Niccol√≤ Machiavelli named Marcus as one of Roman Empire's <q>Five Good Emperors.</q>

                                <p>
                                    Today, he is remembered for his reign as a Roman emperor, writings, and reflective nature.
